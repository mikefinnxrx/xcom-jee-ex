	<h2>XCOM JEE Example</h2>
	<p>This project is an example of a JavaEE project that can be built and deployed to OpenShift.</p>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/snoop.jsp">/snoop.jsp</a>: Comes from JBoss example. Dumps information about the request.</li>
		<li><a href="/diag">/diag</a>: Servlet that will dump the entire environment (HTTP, JVM, etc) as XML</li>
		<li><a href="/killer.jsp">/killer.jsp</a>: Contains a single command, which will perform a System.exit(). This is just for demonstration purposes, to show what happens when an OpenShift pod is killed. If you observe in the console, you will see the current pod die and a new pod start up in its place automatically.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>See the readme.md file contained with this project for instructions on how to set up this application and deploy using openshift</p>
